QUIZ:
1. In machine learning, the computer learns to do new things without you having to explicitly program it .

2. Supervised learning is the branch of machine learning where:
	the computer learns how to perform a function by looking at labeled training data

3. What is a cost function?
	an equation that tells you how wrong an estimator function is with the current weights

4. What can supervised machine learning be used for?
	estimate the risk of issuing a home loan to a potential borrower
	estimate the risk that a patient has a particular medical condition based on their medical test results 
	estimate the value of used cars

GRADIENT BOOSTING: A VERSATILE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM
SAVE GRADIENT BOOSTING: A VERSATILE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM


QUIZ:
Gradient boosting is an algorithm that _____.
	iteratively improves its predictions by adding additional decision trees to improve the predictions of previous trees
	uses an ensemble of small decision trees to estimate value
	can model complex relationships in data

QUIZ:
Which statement about training data is true?
	more training data is usually better than less training data
	a good starting point is to have 10 times as many data points in the training data set as the number of features in the model
	machine learning algorithms work best when your training data set covers a wide range of combinations of features in your model 




************************************************************************************************************
4. FEATURES
************************************************************************************************************
FEATURE ENGINEERING
Feature engineering is using our knowledge of the problem to choose features or create new features that allow machine learning algorithms to work more accurately.
1. Adding or Dropping features - Choosing data with highest amount of signal.
2. Combining mutliple features into one features
3. Binning - Replace exact numerical measurement into a broad category
4. One-hot encoding



CHOOSE THE BEST FEATURES FOR HOME VALUE PREDICTION
USE AS FEW FEATURES AS POSSIBLE: THE CURSE OF DIMENSIONALITY
	So, when building machine learning systems, you should throw in more features just for the sake of throwing in more features. Your goal is to include the features that have the most predictive information and exclude the features that aren`t predictive.
	 The curse of dimensionality says that as we add more features to our model the number of rows of training data that we need to build a good model tends to grow exponentially.

QUIZ:
1. What is one-hot encoding?
	a way to convert categorical data into a format suitable for use in a machine learning model.
2. To get the best results from machine learning, what should  you do?
	use features in your model that correlate strongly with the output values you want to predict
3. Because of the curse of dimensionality, you should include as few features as possible in your model while still accurately modeling the problem .

PREPARE THE FEATURES
TRAINING VS. TESTING DATA
TRAIN THE VALUE ESTIMATOR
MEASURE ACCURACY WITH MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR
QUIZ:
Mean absolute error is a measurement of the average prediction error across your data set .

OVERFITTING AND UNDERFITTING
THE BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION: GRID SEARCH
FEATURE SELECTION
# Create a numpy array based on the model's feature importances
importance = model.feature_importances_

# Sort the feature labels based on the feature importance rankings from the model
feauture_indexes_by_importance = importance.argsort()

# Print each feature label, from most important to least important (reverse order)
for index in feauture_indexes_by_importance:
    print("{} - {:.2f}%".format(feature_labels[index], (importance[index] * 100.0)))

QUIZ : 
1. What is true about overfitting?
	- It occurs when the model is too complex to fit the data
	- It can be addressed by reducing the complexity of the model or using regularization
	- It results in poor prediction accuracy   

2. What is grid search, as is relates to machine learning?
	A way to find the best hyperparameters for a machine learning model by trying many different possible combinations.

3. What is true about feature selection?	
	help us understand which features are most important to your model	
	find features that are not needed and can be removed from your model	
	give us a better idea of which features your model is using most often to predict values

PREDICT VALUES FOR NEW DATA
RETRAIN THE CLASSIFIER WITH FRESH DATA
QUIZ:
1. When using a machine learning model in a real application:
	you should test the accuracy of new models before using them to replace an existing model
	you should consider retraining the model on a regular basis as data changes
	you need to provide the input features in exactly the same format they were provided in during training
